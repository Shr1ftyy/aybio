aybio - ARTIFICIAL LIFE SIM

Brainstorming - What exactly do I want to make?:
 - A player-agent-environment interaction-based game - more exploration than exploitation for the agent to do?
 - A more advanced version of Conway's Game of Life - food, random events, player-populus interaction, etc.
 - An aLife engine - recreating biological phenoma algorithmically.
 - micro-AI-based RTS game (units are intelligent).
 - Player vs. Artificially Intelligent Hostiles.
 - CURRENT PROTOTYPE IDEA: aLife simulator - 2D agents with custom genome coding (what kind of genomes? - t.b.d)

Some questions - these may seem all over the place, so please excuse the lack of organization:
  - What governs the way life behaves?
    - Fitness Functions - scoring based on how agents meet an objective
      - Weighting different fitness functions (minor objectives), which are tuned to follow certain major objectives over time.
      It would be interesting to implement functions that manipulate an agent's desires - exploration vs. exploitation ?
        - 
  - How does life adapt (physically) to its environment, how can we emulate certain physical processes, and do so that we see extremely complex
  emergent behaviour (i.e communication, altruism, etc.)
   
Research - Algorithms, theory, previous implementations and works: 
 - NEAT
 - Polyworld
 - Creatures game franchise

General TODOs:
  - Look into emergent communication between RL agents.
  - Start prototyping... Soonâ„¢.
