Brainstorming - What exactly do I want to make?:
 - A player-agent-environment interaction-based game - more exploration than exploitation for the agent to do?
 - A more advanced version of Conway's Game of Life - food, random events, player-populus interaction, etc.
 - An aLife engine - recreating biological phenoma algorithmically.
 - micro-AI-based RTS game (units are intelligent).
 - Player vs. Artificially Intelligent Hostiles.
 - CURRENT PROTOTYPE IDEA: aLife simulator - 2D agents with custom genome coding (what kind of genomes? - t.b.d)

Questions and what not - these may seem all over the place, so please excuse the lack of organization:
  - What governs the way life behaves?
    - Fitness Functions - scoring based on how agents meet an objective
      - Weighting different fitness functions (minor objectives), which are tuned to follow certain major objectives over time.
      It would be interesting to implement functions that manipulate an agent's desires - exploration vs. exploitation ?
  - How does life adapt (physically) to its environment, how can we emulate certain physical processes, and do so that we see extremely complex
  emergent behaviour (i.e communication, altruism, etc.)

  - Ideas for certain mechanisms:
    - Populate world with different sources of energy, each with its own way of being harnessed.
    The agents should eventually learn to harness these sources of energy for survival, with the help
    of mutation.
    - A toy simulation of abiogenesis?

General TODOs:
  - Look into emergent communication between RL agents.
